# DIFI Source and Sink Examples
The intent of the Digital Intermediate Frequency Interoperability (DIFI) standard is to enable the digital transformation
of space, satellite, and related industries by providing a simple, open, interoperable Digital IF/RF standard that
replaces the natural interoperability of analog IF signals and helps prevent vendor lock-in. The articles linked below
describe how to run the examples which show how to use the DIFI source and sink blocks that implement the DIFI standard
for use with GNU Radio.
